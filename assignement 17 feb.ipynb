    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans=MongoDB is a popular open-source document-oriented NoSQL database management system. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not use tables, rows, and columns to store data. Instead, it stores data in a flexible JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON) that can contain nested structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional tabular structure of rows and columns to store data. Instead, they use a variety of data models, including document-oriented, key-value, graph, and column-family. Non-relational databases are designed to be flexible, scalable, and easily distributed across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in several scenarios, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, MongoDB's flexible document-based data model can be more efficient than a rigidly structured SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "When scaling horizontally, MongoDB's distributed architecture allows for easy expansion by adding additional nodes, while SQL databases may require more complex sharding and partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with real-time applications that require fast reads and writes, MongoDB's high-performance indexing and querying capabilities can provide faster response times than SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "When building modern web applications that require a flexible schema that can evolve over time, MongoDB's dynamic schema design can be more suitable than a static schema in SQL databases.\n",

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans=Document-oriented: MongoDB stores data in a flexible and scalable document-oriented model, where each document is a self-contained unit that can have nested structures and multiple fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Schema: MongoDB has a dynamic schema that allows for flexible and easy data modeling. This means that you can change the structure of your data without having to change the database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Performance: MongoDB has a high-performance indexing and querying system that enables faster reads and writes. It supports several indexing techniques such as single field, compound, geospatial, text search, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal Scalability: MongoDB is designed to be horizontally scalable, which means that you can add more nodes to your cluster to handle more traffic or store more data. MongoDB also provides automatic sharding to distribute data across multiple nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Availability: MongoDB provides high availability through replica sets. Replica sets are groups of MongoDB instances that replicate data across multiple nodes, providing redundancy and automatic failover.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation Framework: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that enables you to perform complex queries and analytics on your data. It supports several aggregation operations such as group, sort, match, project, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "GridFS: MongoDB provides GridFS, which is a file storage system that enables you to store and retrieve large files, such as images, videos, and audio files, in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-Platform Support: MongoDB supports multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and many programming languages such as Python, Java, Node.js, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB's features make it a flexible, scalable, and powerful NoSQL database that can handle complex data management requirements for modern applications.\n",
